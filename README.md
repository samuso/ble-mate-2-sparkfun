### A simple library for BLE Mate2.

This library includes simple commands for communicating with the ble-mate2 through a serial port.
The library can be used to either provide with a simple IO for the user or perform a set of elementary actions needed to use the ble-mate2 for prototyping.

### Setup

To set up the library put them in a directory of the same name as the library and place it in the Arduino's library directory. For more information on setting up visit [THIS LINK](http://arduino.cc/en/guide/libraries).
